<h2>WHAT IS CSS</h2>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language. However, the web would be a boring place if all websites looked like that. Using CSS, you can control exactly how HTML elements look in the browser, presenting your markup using whatever design you like.

<h3>What Can CSS Be Used For</h3>
<p>
    As i have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.
A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.

  <h1>What Is Web Development Briefly?</h1>
  <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development..
  "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.</p>
    <p>The basic tools involved in web development are programming languages called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. There are, however, a number of other programs used to “manage” or facilitate the construction of sites that would otherwise have to be done “from scratch” by writing code.</p>
    <h2>Components of Web Designing</h2>
    <h3>Overall Layout and Visual Appearance</h3>
    <p>our site’s overall look is, of course, a crucial component of web design. We’re using these broad terms to cover a range of reactions you want your website visitor to have. First impressions are critical, so you want to wow your target audience as soon as the web page loads.</p>
    <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
    <p>Finally, the elements you were probably expecting the most once you started reading. Your color palette and fonts will directly inform your visitors’ opinions of your site and are what most novice designers start with.</p>
    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <p>The same industry and demographics principles can generally be said for the typography (or fonts) you choose to communicate your message.</p>

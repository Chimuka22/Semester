<h1>REASONS TO WHY I CHOOSE TO STUDY</h1>
<h2>Network Systems Administration</h2>
<p>I personally find this course interesting because it mostly concentrates on network communication. I'm always curious to know how information is shared and recieved online in seconds.Because looking at back in the information was never sent on soft copy and things were really tough back then and now in the present generation information is just shared in seconds hence i want to be part of the network developers in the word that inprove the mode of communication, making it more easier, faster and reliable for the future generation to not suffer the exact way our parents did.</p>
<p>Another reason to why i'm studying this course is because my parents enhanced my childhood with computers so for this reason i feel the IT department is where i belong because is i feel its a natural thing i can do.</p>
<p>Basically these are the reasons to why i'm pursuing this course</p>
